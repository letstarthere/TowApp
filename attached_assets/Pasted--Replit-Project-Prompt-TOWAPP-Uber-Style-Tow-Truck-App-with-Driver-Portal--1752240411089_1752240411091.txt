## 🚨 Replit Project Prompt: **TOWAPP – Uber-Style Tow Truck App with Driver Portal**

### ✅ Overview:

Build a **full-stack tow truck booking application** called **TOWAPP**, inspired by Uber. The app connects users in need of a tow with available drivers or towing companies. The system should have **two main portals**:

* **User Portal** – for people who need a tow
* **Driver Portal** – for tow truck drivers to manage pickups

It must feature an **Uber-like layout** with a **live map**, **nearby vehicles**, and **real-time price display**.
